Implementation of algorithms to identify Strongly Connected Components in Directed Graphs.
This project has been made as part of an assignment of the course Design And Analysis of Algorithms.
Question 1:
Question 1 of the assignment asks to implement the classical algorithm for finding strongly connected components(Kosaraju and Sharir).

Question 2:
Question 1 of the assignment asks to implement "a divide-and-conquer algorithm for identifying strongly connected components(Don Coppersmith, Lisa Fleischer, Bruce Hendrickson).
